# Chronometer
Android Chronometer App

This app is my first formal android application. So I might be something wrong or a bad way. It is a 
normal chronometer but have some advantages.

Chronometer Specification

-This app's significant point is having a millisecond option in the timer. 
Android Timer structure doesn't support millisecond. It only gives minutes and seconds.

-It also has a dark theme option in Settings.

-You can choose the chronometer time format. If you want to see millisecond, you can choose the millisecond in Settings.
